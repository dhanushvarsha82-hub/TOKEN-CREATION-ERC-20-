The objective of this task is to gain practical experience in blockchain development by creating and deploying a custom ERC-20 token on an Ethereum test network. This task helps in understanding how decentralized applications work and how smart contracts are written, compiled, and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

In this task, a custom ERC-20 token is developed using the Solidity programming language. ERC-20 is a widely accepted token standard on the Ethereum network that defines a set of rules and functions such as total supply, balance checking, and token transfer. By following this standard, the created token becomes compatible with wallets like MetaMask and blockchain explorers such as Etherscan.

The task begins with writing a smart contract in Solidity. The contract defines important token properties including the token name, symbol, number of decimals, and total supply. The total supply of tokens is minted during deployment and is initially assigned to the deployer’s wallet address. This helps in understanding how tokens are created and distributed on the blockchain. OpenZeppelin’s ERC-20 library is used to ensure security and reliability while implementing the standard token functions.

After writing the smart contract, it is compiled and deployed using the Remix IDE, which is a browser-based development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. MetaMask is used as a wallet to connect Remix to an Ethereum test network such as Sepolia. Testnet Ether is used to pay for gas fees, allowing deployment without using real money. This step provides hands-on experience with interacting with the blockchain and managing transactions.

Once the contract is successfully deployed, the deployed contract address is obtained and verified using a blockchain explorer. The token is then added to the MetaMask wallet using the contract address, allowing the user to view the token balance and confirm that the token was minted correctly. This step demonstrates how tokens become visible and usable in real wallets.

As part of the task deliverables, the smart contract source code, token details (such as name, symbol, supply, and network), and deployment proof are collected. Deployment proof includes screenshots of the deployed contract, transaction confirmation, and token balance display. These proofs ensure that the task has been completed practically and not just theoretically.
